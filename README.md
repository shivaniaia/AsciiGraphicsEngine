# AsciiGraphicsEngine
C++ Console Application that functions as a Vector Graphics ASCII Art Engine.

Its a Drawing Program that operates entirely within the terminal, allowing users to create colored geometric shapes using ascii characters by inputing its position/coordinates on a grid and the desired dimensions. It is a Vector Graphics system, meaning shapes are stored as mathematical blueprints rather than individual pixels.

Also contains a Demo Scenery Graphic, hence the long lines of code towards the end of the program. Just a cool fun art thing :P
